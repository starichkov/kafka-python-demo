# Apache Kafka Python Demo

## 🧩 Overview

A minimal Apache Kafka demo using Python featuring:
- A **JSON-producing** `producer.py`
- A **format-tolerant** `consumer.py` supporting JSON & plain text
- Partition-awareness, message keying, and consumer group support
- Integration testing via `Testcontainers`
- GitHub Actions & Codecov integration

It’s designed to simulate a polyglot messaging environment, where different systems or services might produce data in different formats to the same Apache Kafka topic.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Docker & Docker Compose (for container-based setup) - more details could be found in the [separate section](documentation/docker.md).
- Apache Kafka (external or Dockerized)

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Demo

### 1. Start Apache Kafka

You can start Apache Kafka using Docker. For example:

```shell
docker run -d --name kafka-391 \
  -p 9092:9092 \
  apache/kafka:3.9.1
```

More information about helper scripts Kafka provides could be found in the [separate section](documentation/kafka.md).

### 🟢 Run Producer

```bash
python producer.py
```

Produces random JSON events (`note_created`, `note_updated`, `note_deleted`) with message keys for partitioning.

### 🔵 Run Consumer

```bash
python consumer.py                   # All events
python consumer.py --event-type X   # Filtered by event_type
python consumer.py --group-id my-group
```

Displays event type, partition, and offset info.

---

### 🔑 Message Keys and Partitions

The producer now uses the message's `event_type` as the Kafka **key**, which ensures that:

- All events of the same type (e.g. `note_created`) are sent to the **same partition**
- Kafka can guarantee **ordering per event type**

The consumer now displays Kafka metadata per message, including:

- **Key** — the event type used for partitioning
- **Partition** — which partition the message was written to
- **Offset** — the message's position in the partition log

This helps visualize how Kafka distributes messages based on keys.

Example output:

```
✅ JSON (note_created) | key=note_created | partition=1 | offset=42 → {...}
```

**Note:** Kafka's key-based partitioning uses an internal hash function.
With a small number of keys (e.g., only `note_created`, `note_updated`, and `note_deleted`), multiple keys may hash to the same partition.

As a result:
- You may see **some partitions receive no messages**
- This is expected behavior with small key sets
- Kafka **guarantees same key → same partition**, but **not even distribution** across partitions

To see all partitions used, try increasing the number of unique keys or remove the key to enable round-robin distribution.

---

### 👥 Consumer Groups and Partition Rebalancing

Kafka uses consumer groups to distribute the workload of processing messages across multiple consumers.

- Consumers in the **same group** share topic partitions — each partition is consumed by only **one group member**
- If a consumer **joins or leaves** the group, Kafka triggers a **rebalance**
- Kafka automatically assigns partitions based on availability and group size

This project supports an optional `--group-id` parameter in the consumer:

```shell
python consumer.py --group-id demo-group
```

Running multiple consumers with the same group ID simulates real-world partition-based load balancing. You can observe which partitions each consumer receives by inspecting the output:

```
✅ JSON (note_created) | key=note_created | partition=2 | offset=15 → ...
```

Note: If you have more partitions than consumers, some consumers may receive multiple partitions. If you have more consumers than partitions, some may remain idle.

## 📌 Notes

- Topic name is hardcoded as `test-topic` in both scripts.
- You can edit the scripts to change topic names or message structures.
- This setup is great for local experimentation or as a starting point for more advanced Apache Kafka integrations.
