## üê≥ Docker Setup

This project includes Docker support to run the entire stack (Kafka, producer, and consumer) in containers.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Running with Docker Compose

1. Build and start all services:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will start:
    - Kafka (using the official Apache Kafka image in KRaft mode without Zookeeper)
    - Producer (which will start sending messages immediately)
    - Consumer (which will start consuming messages immediately)

    The Dockerfiles for the producer and consumer automatically modify the Python scripts to use environment variables for Kafka connection, making them ready to connect to the Kafka service in the Docker network.

2. View logs from the consumer:

    ```shell
    docker logs -f kafka-consumer
    ```

3. View logs from the producer:

    ```shell
    docker logs -f kafka-producer
    ```

### Customizing the Consumer

You can customize the consumer by modifying the `command` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
consumer:
  # ... other settings ...
  command: ["--group-id", "demo-group"]
```

Available options:
- `--group-id` or `-g`: Set a consumer group ID
- `--event-type` or `-e`: Filter by event type

### Stopping the Services

To stop all services:

```shell
docker-compose down
```
