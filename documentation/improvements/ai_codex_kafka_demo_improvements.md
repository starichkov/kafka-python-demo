# Kafka Python Demo â€“ Queue-Oriented Enhancements

## 1. Surface message headers for interop with other brokers
Goal: Offer parity with systems like RabbitMQ/AMQP that rely on message headers for metadata and correlation IDs.  
Ideas:
- Attach headers (e.g., `correlation_id`) in the producer.
- Extract and log headers in the consumer to show metadata passing through Kafka.
- Add an integration test verifying a header is preserved end-to-end.

## 2. Manual offset commits to mimic explicit acknowledgements
Goal: Mimic explicit acknowledgments from queue-based systems.  
Ideas:
- Set `enable_auto_commit=False` so the consumer commits only after successful processing.
- Wrap processing in try/except and commit offsets only when processing succeeds.
- Add a flag or environment variable to enable/disable this behavior.
- Write tests proving that uncommitted messages are reprocessed after a crash.

## 3. Dead-letter topic for failed messages
Goal: Provide a safe destination for messages that fail to process.  
Ideas:
- On exception, publish the message (and headers) to a dead-letter topic via a lightweight producer.
- Allow configuring the dead-letter topic name via environment variable.
- Document this feature in the README.
- Add tests that force an exception and verify the message appears on the dead-letter topic.

## 4. Request/response (RPC) example
Goal: Emulate RPC-style messaging familiar to queue users.  
Ideas:
- Create a `requester.py` that sends a message with a `reply_to` header and unique correlation ID, then waits on a temporary reply topic.
- Create a `responder.py` that reads requests, processes them, and publishes responses to the `reply_to` topic with the same correlation ID.
- Add integration tests verifying the request/response round trip using Testcontainers or similar.

## 5. Schema validation
Goal: Enforce structured payloads, similar to strongly typed message brokers.  
Ideas:
- Define a JSON schema (or Avro schema) for your events.
- Validate messages before sending in the producer.
- Optionally validate incoming payloads in the consumer and log schema errors separately.
- Update dependencies (e.g., `jsonschema`) and add tests for both valid and invalid payloads.

## 6. Idempotent producer & transactions
Goal: Demonstrate exactly-once semantics and transactional guarantees.  
Ideas:
- Initialize the producer with `enable_idempotence=True`.
- Wrap send operations in `begin_transaction` / `commit_transaction` blocks and handle `abort_transaction` on failures.
- Optionally expose a CLI flag to toggle transactional mode.
- Write tests covering commit and abort scenarios to verify no duplicates on retries.

## 7. Migration guide
Goal: Help queue-oriented developers map their concepts to Kafka terms.  
Ideas:
- Add a `documentation/migration.md` or a new README section explaining concepts like:
  - Queue vs. topic
  - Ack vs. offset commit
  - Dead-letter queue vs. dead-letter topic
  - Request/reply patterns
  - Schemas, transactions, etc.
- Link the guide from the main README.
